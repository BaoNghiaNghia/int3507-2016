* Open **Start**, enter **Device Manager**, and select it from the list of results. Under **Sound, video, and game controllers**, select your sound card, open it, select the **Driver** tab, and select **Update Driver**. If Windows doesn''t find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer''s website and follow their instructions.﻿﻿﻿﻿

If that didn''t work, try this:
* Uninstall your audio driver: open **Device Manager**, right-click (or tap and hold) the audio driver, and select **Uninstall**. Restart your device and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.

And if that didn''t work, try using the generic audio driver that comes with Windows. Here''s how:
* Open **Device Manager**, right-click (or tap and hold) your audio driver > **Update driver software... > Browse my computer for driver software > Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer**, select **High Definition Audio Device**, select **Next**, and follow the instructions to install it.'),

* Check your speaker and headphone connections for loose cables or the wrong jack.
* Check your power and volume levels, and try turning all the volume controls up.
* Some speakers and apps have their own volume controls, and you might have to check them all.

'Make sure your printer is turned on and connected to your PC.

If it still won''t work, try running the [printing troubleshooter](http://aka.ms/diag_printer10).

If you’re still having problems, your printer may need a new driver.

Open **Start**, enter **Devices and Printers**, select it from the list of results, and select your printer. Then select **Remove** device at the top of the screen and reinstall your printer.
If Windows doesn’t automatically find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer''s website and follow their installation instructions.');
