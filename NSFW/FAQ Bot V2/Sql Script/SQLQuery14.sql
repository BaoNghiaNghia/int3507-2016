'Windows 10 has Mail and Calendar apps already built in. Find them by selecting the Start button, or type mail or calendar in the search box on the taskbar.

# Email and scheduling rockstar
You"ve found the apps, now make them useful by adding your accounts. If this is the first time you"re opening either of the apps, you"ll see the Welcome page. Follow the instructions to set up your account. Otherwise:
1. In the Mail or Calendar app, select Settings  at the bottom left.
2. Go to Manage Accounts > Add account, choose your account type, and then follow the instructions.
Your mail and calendar start syncing as soon as your account is set up.
* A couple of other handy things you may want to know:
* After you"ve calmed down from the excitement of adding one account, you can go back to Settings to add more.
* No need to add the same account twice—when you add it to one app, the other app automatically connects to the same account. Switch back and forth between the two by selecting the Mail or Calendar icons at the bottom left side of the window.
* Delete an account at any time by going to Settings  > Manage Accounts, and then choosing the account you want to delete. Select Delete account. (If you"ve signed in to your PC with a Microsoft account, that account is added automatically to the Mail and Calendar apps and can"t be deleted. But you can remove any others you added yourself.)
* If you have more questions about how to use the apps, including troubleshooting info if you"re having problems adding an account, find answers by going to Settings  > Help. (Then select Open Help in the Mail app.)

# Where are my contacts?
When you add an account, either through the Mail and Calendar apps or other social media apps, any contacts associated with those accounts will show up in the People app. Find the People app by typing People in the search box on the taskbar.',

'Usually, you’ll see duplicate contacts when you have the same person saved in multiple accounts, with slightly different info in each one. To fix this, you can link the duplicate contacts. We’ll combine the info from both contacts, and then you’ll only see one with that name. To link contacts:
1. Open the People app.
2. Select the contact you want to link, then select the chain-shaped Link button.
3. Select Choose a contact to link, then pick a contact from your contact list.',
